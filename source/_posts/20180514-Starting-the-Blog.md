Finally I started this blog.

<!-- more -->

60 Yaks per Second is a hobby project making games. This blog will be talking about those games, and any cool tech I feel like writing about along the way.

I'm a programmer by trade, so this will probably be a technical blog, where I hope to talk about architecture and ECS design. Unity is my game engine of choice but there may be others mentioned from time to time.
